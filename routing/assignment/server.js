// 1. import express
// 2. Make a variable call app and assign it to express()
// 3. Make a variable call port and assign it the value 3000
// 4. import jsonfile

//middlewares: check documentation to use body-parser (hint: call express)

//Routing Example
//1) Sending and reading text on the browser:
//2) Open a browser and type in: localhost:3000
app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("Hello world")); //"Hello world"  should show up

//Sending a Get request to /persons to Read a list of persons

//Send a Get request to server at /persons/:id to READ(view)

//Send a Post request to /persons, add new person in persons object in data.json file

//Send a PUT request to /quotes/:id to update a quote

//Send a delete request to /quotes/:id to delete a person

// 5. Render app.listen() so the server will load in localhost:3000
